Head over to [this link](https://github.com/SatvikVejendla/Neural-Network-Module/releases/download/java1.0.0/NeuralNetwork.zip) to download the source code

Once it's finished installing, extract the files and copy them into the project folder that you want to implement it in. From there, you can just use all the function normally.
